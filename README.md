<p align="center">I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies and domains ðŸ’¡.</p>
<p align="center">I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems âœ¨. I'm currently working to improve my Data Structures and Algorithm skills ðŸ¤¯.</p>

# Technologies Stack ðŸš€

<p align="center">My primary skills include:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend development with Python, Flask and Django
- Database design and management (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Deployment and scaling on cloud platforms (AWS, Heroku)
</p>

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, trying to get out of Escape rooms, or cycling.
