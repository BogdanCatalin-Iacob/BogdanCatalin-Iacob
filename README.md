ðŸ‘€ Hi there! I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with experience building and deploying applications. I have a passion for designing and implementing intuitive user experiences and am always looking for new and innovative ways to solve problems.

My primary skills include:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend development with Python, Flask and Django
- Database design and management (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Deployment and scaling on cloud platforms (AWS, Heroku)

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, trying to get out of Escape rooms, or cycling.

Feel free to check out my portfolio and connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always open to discussing new opportunities!
